# Class 00

## The goal of this course
We're here to learn the fundamentals of computer science and software development. I say computer science and software development because in my mind they are two different pursuits. 

Computer science is the study of what computers can do, it includes topics like complexity analysis, algorithms, data structures. It can include programming language study and design, compiler construction, and many other topics not directly relevant or applicable to work a professional programmers does.

Software development is problem solving using a programming language. It's the gettings things done part of the equation. Debugging, testing, test driven development, refactoring, dependency management, and using your tools well are all software development skills.

## Who is this course for?
Learn how to print to the console, when I first learned how to program, this is how I debugged all my programs. Tons of extra print statements.
