# Class 00

## Goal of this course
We're here to learn the fundamentals of computer science and software development. I say computer science and software development because in my mind they are two different pursuits. 

Computer science is the study of what computers can do, it includes topics like complexity analysis, algorithms, data structures. It can include programming language study and design, compiler construction, and many other topics not directly relevant or applicable to work a professional programmers does.

Software development is problem solving using a programming language. It's the gettings things done part of the equation. Debugging, testing, test driven development, refactoring, dependency management, and using your tools well are all software development skills.

## Is this the course for you?
This course is for someone who either wants to learn computer science basics and how to program or someone who has been out of school for a long enough time to want a refresher that starts at the very beginning. If you're an experienced programmer it might be too slow paced for you, especially at the beginning.

## Dev environment setup
Look at the README.md in the root of the repository. Section **Dev environment setup**

## Who is this course for?
Learn how to print to the console, when I first learned how to program, this is how I debugged all my programs. Tons of extra print statements.

# Exercises
## Exercise 1
Write "Hello, world!" to the console.

## Exercise 2 - Harder
1. Write a function that returns the value "Hello, world!"
2. Write a function to test it using the Pytest framework.
