# Class 01

Learn how to print to the console, when I first learned how to program, this is how I debugged all my programs. Tons of extra print statements.
- Write "Hello, world!" to the console.

Functions are the building blocks of abstraction, and abstraction is key to building a good program. When you call print("My name is John") you don't care how that string gets printed, you only care about it working.
- Write a function that squares the number you pass in.
- Write a function that cubes the number you paass in.

What would happen if a function called **def square(x)** actually added one to the number and returned it?

What type of issue is this?
