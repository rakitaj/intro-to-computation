# Introduction to Programming & Computer Science
## Course syllabus and tips

This course will give you an overview of programming and assumes you have no experience. 
## Class session 0 - Introduction
Read after: Chapter 1 - Getting started

Session topics:  
- Goal of this course
- Is this course for you?
- Dev environment setup 
- Printing to the console aka "Hello, world!"

## Class session 1 - Simple functions, syntax, and programming languages
Read before: Nothing

Session topics:
- Functions, parameters, arguments, basic Python syntax

## Class session 2 - Conditionals, looping
Read before: Chapter 2 - Introduction to Python

Session topics:
- Conditionals **if/else**
- Looping with **while**
- Break statement

## Class session 3 - More looping, problem solving techniques
Read before: Chapter 3 - Some Simple Numerical Programs

Session topics:
- Looping with **for**
- Casting variables
- Techniques to solve problems
  - Exhaustive enumeration aka brute force
  - Bisection search aka eliminate half each iteration

## Class session 4 - Functions in depth, scope
Read before: Chapter 4 - Functions, scoping, and abstraction

Session topics:
- More about functions
- Scope
- Finding the right abstraction

## Class session 5 - Container types, higher-order functions
Read before: Chapter 5 - Structured types, mutability, and higher-order functions

Session topics:
- Lists, dictionaries, tuples
- Higher-order functions

# Tips
- If you can't figure out what a chunk of code is doing or why, try hand simulating it and then if possible comparing that result to what the computer produces.

# Dev environment setup
1. Install Python 3.5 or higher
2. Git clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/rakitaj/intro-to-computation.git
```
3. Optional - setup a virtual environment
4. Optional - activate your virtual environment
```
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\scripts\activate
```
5. Install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Themes of the class
- Systematic problem solving
- The power of abstraction
- Computation as a way of thinking about the world
